                                Project Tracker is a system that allows the instructor to track the work of a group 
                                of students on a specific project. At the same time students can use the system to
                                manage their work and with the instructor. Suppose we have a class with enough number 
                                of students to be divided into two groups or more, Therefore, the instructor has the
                                ability to assign each student to a specific team and give each member a specific role. 
                                Moreover, the instructor can create a project with required specifications and properties
                                such as tasks, time, deliverables, etc. Students in the same team can communicate together
                                by broadcasting a message that appears on all team members' side. They can also communicate 
                                with the instructor. At any time, students can set the status of a task as to start later on,
                                working on, finished on time, finished with delay, etc. and the instructor can review the 
                                task and give feedback for students on the task.

                                The task has a title, description, progress estimation, start date, end due date,
                                actual end date, or any other suggested properties. The task can be assigned to one or
                                more of the students. Group members or the instructor can put a comment on the task 
                                and others can reply to it.
